# Object Detection with OpenCV

This repository includes the application of OpenCV for object detection purpose.
I have used pre-trained `mobilenet version 3` with capability to detect 80 different classes.

This is just for the demonstration purpose hence pre-trained model is no tweaked in any way to improve the performance.
